  "Location": "Where in the body the abnormality is located", eg, brain,lungs
  "Confidence Score (%)": "Confidence score in percentage",
  "Further Evaluation Required": "True/False if further medical evaluation is required"
}

Make sure to fill in each field with accurate and relevant information based on the image analysis. If no abnormality is found, output should be structured as follows:

{
  "Abnormality Type": "N/A",
  "Size (cm)": "N/A",
  "Location": "N/A",
  "Confidence Score (%)": "N/A",
  "Further Evaluation Required": "N/A"
